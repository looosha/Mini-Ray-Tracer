# Mini-Ray-Tracer

Mini Ray Tracer is a 3D-graphics renderer that synthesizes a photorealistic snapshot of a scene, individually tracing the path of each ray from the observer's perspective. It is a working console application where the input is a description of the 3-dimensional scene and the output is a PNG image.

This self-proposed project was created to fulfill one of the requirements of the course COMP 2012H Fall 2019 in HKUST. 

## Acknowledgments

The project was inspired by the <em> Ray Tracing </m> series of Peter Shirley books.
